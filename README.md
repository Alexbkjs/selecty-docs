# Selecty Documentation

This repository contains the official documentation for Selecty, a Shopify app that helps merchants create language, currency, and market switchers for their international stores.

## Overview

The documentation is built using [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/), a modern documentation platform that transforms MDX files into beautiful, searchable documentation sites.

## Public Access

The documentation is publicly accessible via Mintlify's hosting platform. The site is connected directly to this GitHub repository through the Mintlify dashboard, which automatically deploys changes when pushed to the main branch.

**Important:** Any changes pushed to the `main` branch will be automatically deployed to the live documentation site.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Mintlify CLI

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd selecty-docs
   ```

2. **Install Mintlify CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g mintlify
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   mintlify dev
   ```

   The documentation site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Editing Documentation

- All documentation files are located in the `/docs` directory
- Files use the `.mdx` format (Markdown with JSX components)
- Each page requires YAML frontmatter with `title` and `description`
- The navigation structure is defined in `docs/docs.json`

## AI Assistant Widget

The documentation includes an embedded AI assistant widget that helps users find information quickly.

### Important: JavaScript Files in /docs

**All `.js` files located within the `/docs` folder are executed on every page of the documentation site.** This is how the AI assistant widget is injected into the documentation.

### Widget Versions

There are two versions of the assistant widget:

#### Development Version
- **File:** `docs/assistant-widget.iife(dev).js`
- **API Endpoint:** `http://localhost:9000`
- **Usage:** For local testing and development

#### Production Version
- **File:** `assistant-widget.iife.js` (root directory)
- **API Endpoint:** `https://rag-docs-api.vercel.app/api/chat`
- **Usage:** For the live documentation site

### Testing the Widget Locally

To test the AI assistant widget in your local development environment:

1. **Start the backend service:**

   The widget requires a backend service running on `localhost:9000` to handle API requests. This service communicates with your vector store and OpenAI API.

   ```bash
   # Navigate to your backend service directory
   cd /path/to/backend-service

   # Start the service (ensure it runs on port 9000)
   npm start
   ```

2. **Use the dev widget:**

   Ensure that `docs/assistant-widget.iife(dev).js` is present in your docs folder. This version points to your local backend.

3. **Start Mintlify dev server:**

   ```bash
   mintlify dev
   ```

4. **Test the widget:**

   Open `http://localhost:3000` and interact with the AI assistant to verify it's working with your local backend.

### Production Widget

The production version uses a Vercel serverless function hosted at:
```
https://rag-docs-api.vercel.app/api/chat
```

This function handles all API requests for the live documentation site, including:
- Vector store queries
- OpenAI API communication
- Context retrieval and response generation

## Content Guidelines

When contributing to the documentation:

1. **Use second-person voice** ("you" rather than "we")
2. **Include prerequisites** at the start of procedural content
3. **Test all code examples** before publishing
4. **Match existing style** and formatting patterns
5. **Add frontmatter** to all MDX files:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: Page Title
   description: Brief description for SEO
   ---
   ```

## Git Workflow

- Always create a new branch for changes
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Never use `--no-verify` when committing (preserves pre-commit hooks)
- Push changes and create pull requests for review
- Changes to `main` are automatically deployed to production
