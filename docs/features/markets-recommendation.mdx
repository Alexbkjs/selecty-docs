title: Markets Recommendation
description: Automatically suggest language and currency based on visitor location and preferences
---


The Markets Recommendation feature displays a banner to first-time visitors, suggesting they switch to their local language and currency based on their location and browser preferences. This creates a personalized shopping experience without forcing automatic changes.

## How It Works

When someone visits your store for the first time, Selecty automatically:

1. **Detects their location** using IP geolocation
2. **Identifies their language preference** from browser settings
3. **Displays a recommendation banner** suggesting the most relevant language and currency
4. **Remembers their choice** so the banner doesn't appear on subsequent visits

<Info>
Recommendation banners appear only on the first visit. Once a visitor makes a choice or dismisses the banner, Selecty remembers their preference using browser cookies.
</Info>

## Why Use Recommendations Instead of Auto-Redirect?

Google and other search engines recommend against automatic redirects for multilingual websites because:

- **SEO Impact** - Automatic redirects can interfere with proper indexing of multilingual content
- **User Control** - Recommendations give users choice rather than forcing changes
- **Better UX** - Visitors can review the suggestion before accepting

<Tip>
We strongly recommend using recommendation banners instead of automatic redirects. See our [SEO guide](/advanced/seo) and [Markets Redirect](/features/markets-redirect) documentation for more details.
</Tip>

## Detection Methods

### Language Detection

Selecty detects language preferences from the visitor's browser settings.

**How Browser Language Works:**

Browsers maintain a list of preferred languages that you can configure in settings. The first language in this list is what Selecty uses for recommendations.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chrome">
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Languages**
    2. View your preferred languages list
    3. The top language is your primary preference
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Firefox">
    1. Go to **Settings**
    2. Scroll to **Language** section
    3. Check your preferred languages order
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Safari">
    1. Go to **Preferences** → **General**
    2. Check **Preferred languages**
    3. Language order determines priority
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Edge">
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Languages**
    2. View preferred languages
    3. Top language is used for detection
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Browser language and display language can be different. For example, you might use German as your browser display language but have English set as your preferred content language.
</Note>

### Country and Currency Detection

Country and currency are detected using **IP geolocation**.

**How It Works:**

1. Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns you an IP address
2. Selecty uses this IP to determine your country of residence
3. Based on the country, Selecty suggests the local currency

<Warning>
IP geolocation is generally accurate but not perfect. VPNs, proxies, and some corporate networks may show incorrect locations.
</Warning>

## Testing Your Banner

To test your recommendation banner:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use a VPN">
    Enable a VPN to simulate visiting from a different country. Make sure:
    - The VPN country is different from your primary market
    - The VPN is active in incognito mode if using a browser extension
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Incognito/Private Window">
    Use incognito mode to simulate a first-time visitor:
    - **Chrome:** Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows) or ⌘+Shift+N (Mac)
    - **Firefox:** Ctrl+Shift+P or ⌘+Shift+P
    - **Safari:** ⌘+Shift+N
  </Step>

  <Step title="Visit Your Store">
    Navigate to your store in the incognito window. The banner should appear if:
    - Your location (via VPN) matches a different market
    - The banner is enabled in Selecty
    - You haven't dismissed it before in this browser
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Banner not appearing">
    **Check these settings:**
    - Banner is enabled in Selecty app
    - You're testing in incognito mode
    - VPN is set to a different market
    - Shopify's auto-redirect is disabled (Settings → Markets → Preferences)
    - Markets Redirect is disabled in Selecty app
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong language suggested">
    The language is based on browser settings, not location. Check your browser's preferred languages list in settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong currency/country suggested">
    This uses IP geolocation. VPNs, proxies, and some networks may show incorrect locations. Try a different VPN server.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Banner appears every time">
    Clear your browser cookies and cache, then test again. The banner should only appear once per unique visitor.
  </Accordion>
