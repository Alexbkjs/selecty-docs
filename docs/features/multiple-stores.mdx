title: Multiple Stores Connection
description: Connect and manage multiple Shopify stores for different regions with seamless customer redirection
---


Selecty's Multiple Stores feature allows you to connect separate Shopify stores and redirect customers to the appropriate store based on their location and preferences. This is ideal for businesses with distinct regional operations or specific market requirements.

## Why Multiple Stores?

While [Shopify Markets](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets) provides excellent multi-market management, some businesses still need separate stores for different regions.

### Common Reasons for Multiple Stores

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

Selecty connects multiple Shopify stores and enables intelligent cross-store redirection:

1. **Store Connection** - Link your stores using secure tokens
2. **Geolocation Detection** - Identify visitor location via IP address
3. **Automatic Redirection** - Guide customers to their regional store
4. **Recommendation Banner** - Suggest the appropriate store without forcing redirect

**Example Scenario:**

You have three stores:
- **US Store** (primary) - example-us.com
- **France Store** - example-fr.com
- **Spain Store** - example-es.com

When a customer from France visits example-us.com, they're automatically redirected to example-fr.com, or see a banner suggesting they switch to the French store.

## Setting Up Store Connections

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Selecty on All Stores">
    Install the Selecty app on every store you want to connect. Each store must have its own Selecty installation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Your Primary Store">
    Decide which store will be your primary/central hub. This is typically your main market or highest-volume store.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Connection Token">
    On each **secondary store**:
    1. Open Selecty app
    2. Go to **Stores** in the left menu
    3. Click **Join Connection**
    4. Copy the generated token
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to Primary Store">
    On your **primary store**:
    1. Open Selecty app
    2. Go to **Stores**
    3. Click **Connect Store**
    4. Paste the token from the secondary store
    5. Click **Connect**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat for Additional Stores">
    Repeat steps 3-4 for each additional store you want to connect.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Synchronize Stores">
    Once all stores are connected:
    1. Click **Sync Stores** button
    2. Wait for synchronization to complete
    3. Verify all stores appear in your connected stores list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Redirect Settings">
    Choose your redirect method:
    - **Auto-redirect** - Automatic redirection to appropriate store
    - **Recommendation banner** - Suggest store switch to visitors
    - **Both** - Banner first, then auto-redirect if not dismissed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connection Architecture

### Primary Store Setup

Your primary store acts as the central hub:

- Manages connections to all secondary stores
- Controls sync settings and redirect rules
- Typically your main or original market

### Secondary Store Setup

Secondary stores:

- Generate connection tokens
- Join the connection managed by primary store
- Receive configuration from primary store
- Can have unique selectors and banners

<Note>
All stores in the connection network must have active Selecty subscriptions. The connection uses secure tokens and encrypted communication between stores.
</Note>

## Redirect Configuration

### Auto-Redirect Mode

Automatically redirect visitors to their regional store.

**Configuration:**
1. Enable **Auto-redirect** in the Stores section
2. Map countries to stores (France → French store)
3. Set fallback store for unmapped countries
4. Configure redirect timing and behavior

<Warning>
Similar to Markets Redirect, auto-redirect between stores can impact SEO. Consider using recommendation banners for a better user experience.
</Warning>

### Recommendation Banner Mode

Display a banner suggesting the appropriate store.

**Configuration:**
1. Enable **Market Recommendations** in the Stores section
2. Customize banner appearance and messaging
3. Set which stores to recommend for which regions
4. Configure banner timing and display frequency

<Tip>
Recommendation banners are the recommended approach as they:
- Give users control over the switch
- Provide better SEO (no forced redirects)
- Allow users to stay on current store if preferred
</Tip>

## Managing Connected Stores

### Viewing Connected Stores

In the Selecty app's **Stores** section, you'll see:

- List of all connected stores
- Store URLs and names
- Connection status (active, pending, error)
- Last sync timestamp

### Disconnecting Stores

To remove a store from the connection:

1. Go to **Stores** section in primary store
2. Find the store you want to disconnect
3. Click **Disconnect** or remove icon
4. Confirm the disconnection

<Note>
Disconnecting a store doesn't uninstall Selecty from that store. It only removes it from the multi-store connection network.
</Note>

### Synchronizing Changes

Click **Sync Stores** whenever you:

- Add a new store to the connection
- Update redirect rules or settings
- Change market configurations
- Modify banner settings
