title: Markets Redirect
description: Automatically redirect visitors to their local market based on location and language
---


Markets Redirect automatically redirects visitors to their appropriate local market based on their IP geolocation and browser language preferences. This feature provides instant localization without requiring user input.

<Warning>
**Important SEO Consideration**

Google recommends against using automatic redirects for multilingual websites as they can negatively impact SEO indexing. We strongly suggest using [Markets Recommendation](/features/markets-recommendation) banners instead, which give users control while still providing personalized suggestions.

See our [SEO guide](/advanced/seo) for more details.
</Warning>

## How It Works

When enabled, Markets Redirect automatically detects:

1. **Visitor's Country** - Using IP geolocation
2. **Visitor's Language** - From browser language preferences
3. **Appropriate Market** - Matches location and language to your configured markets
4. **Automatic Redirect** - Seamlessly redirects to the correct market

## When to Use Markets Redirect

Markets Redirect may be appropriate for:

- Stores with completely separate regional websites (different domains)
- B2B stores where automatic localization is expected
- Stores in specific industries where geo-targeting is standard practice
- Markets with distinct product catalogs by region

<Info>
For most Shopify stores using Markets, we recommend [Markets Recommendation](/features/markets-recommendation) banners instead of automatic redirects. Recommendations provide better SEO, user control, and flexibility.

## Enabling Markets Redirect

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Selecty App">
    Navigate to the Selecty app in your Shopify admin.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Markets Redirect Section">
    Scroll to the **Markets Redirect** section on the dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Redirect Options">
    Toggle on the redirect features you want:

    - **Auto-redirect by country** - Redirects based on IP geolocation
    - **Auto-redirect by language** - Redirects based on browser language
    - **Combined redirect** - Uses both country and language detection
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Rules (Optional)">
    Set up redirect rules:
    - Exclude specific countries or languages
    - Set redirect priority when multiple markets match
    - Configure redirect timing and behavior
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to activate Markets Redirect.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Redirect Methods

### Country-Based Redirect

Automatically redirect visitors based on their geographical location.

**How it works:**
- Detects visitor's country via IP address
- Matches country to your configured markets
- Redirects to the appropriate market for that country

**Example:**
- Visitor from France → Redirected to French market
- Visitor from Germany → Redirected to German market
- Visitor from Canada → Redirected to Canadian market

### Language-Based Redirect

Redirect visitors based on their browser's preferred language settings.

**How it works:**
- Reads the visitor's browser language preferences
- Matches language to your available markets
- Redirects to market with matching language

**Example:**
- Browser set to Spanish → Redirected to Spanish language market
- Browser set to Japanese → Redirected to Japanese language market

### Combined Redirect

Uses both country and language to find the best match.

**How it works:**
1. Detects both country (IP) and language (browser)
2. Looks for a market that matches both
3. Falls back to country-only match if no perfect match exists

**Example:**
- French visitor with French browser → France market (perfect match)
- French visitor with English browser → France market (country match)
- Spanish visitor with French browser → Spain market (country priority)

## Bot Detection

Selecty includes bot detection to prevent search engine crawlers from being redirected, which helps maintain SEO integrity.

**How it works:**

- Identifies common search engine bots (Google, Bing, etc.)
- Allows bots to access all market versions for proper indexing
- Only redirects human visitors

<Note>
**Important Limitation**

While Selecty's bot detection is sophisticated, no detection algorithm can guarantee 100% accuracy. Some bots may be redirected, and some human visitors may not be. This is an inherent limitation of automated bot detection technology.
</Note>

## Configuration Options

### Redirect Exclusions

Exclude specific scenarios from automatic redirection:

- **Countries** - Don't redirect visitors from certain countries
- **Languages** - Skip redirect for specific languages
- **Pages** - Exclude specific URLs (cart, checkout, etc.)
- **First-time visitors only** - Only redirect on first visit

### Redirect Behavior

Control how redirects function:

- **Redirect timing** - Immediate or delayed redirect
- **Cookie duration** - How long to remember redirect preference
- **Manual override** - Allow users to switch back
- **Redirect frequency** - Once per session or on every visit

## Disabling Shopify's Native Redirect

To avoid conflicts, disable Shopify's built-in market redirect:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Shopify Settings">
    In Shopify admin, go to **Settings** → **Markets**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Other Markets">
    In the **Other markets** section, click **Preferences**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Disable Domain Redirection">
    Turn off the **Domain/subfolder redirection** option.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Save your changes to prevent Shopify's automatic redirects from interfering with Selecty.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## SEO Considerations

### Impact on Search Rankings

Automatic redirects can affect your store's SEO in several ways:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Search Engine Indexing">
    - Bots may not properly index all language/market versions
    - Hreflang tags may not be correctly processed
    - Different market content may not appear in search results
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Duplication">
    - Search engines may view markets as duplicate content
    - Canonical tags must be properly configured
    - Each market should have unique, valuable content
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Experience Signals">
    - High bounce rates if visitors are redirected incorrectly
    - Reduced time-on-site if redirect feels forced
    - Lower engagement if language doesn't match expectations
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Google's Recommendation

According to [Google's multilingual site guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/managing-multi-regional-sites):

> "Avoid automatic redirection based on the user's perceived language. These redirections could prevent users (and search engines) from viewing all the versions of your site."

<Tip>
For better SEO and user experience, use [Markets Recommendation](/features/markets-recommendation) banners that suggest rather than force locale changes.
</Tip>

## Testing Redirects

To test Markets Redirect functionality:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable VPN">
    Use a VPN to simulate visiting from different countries. Ensure the VPN is set to a country with a different market than your primary one.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clear Cookies">
    Clear browser cookies or use incognito/private mode to simulate a first-time visit.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Visit Your Store">
    Navigate to your store's primary URL and verify you're redirected to the appropriate market.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Different Locations">
    Change VPN locations and test multiple markets to ensure proper redirect behavior.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
See our detailed [Testing Geolocation](/advanced/testing-geolocation) guide for comprehensive testing instructions.
