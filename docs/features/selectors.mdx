description: Create and customize language, currency, and market switchers for your store
---


Selectors are customizable switchers that allow your customers to manually change their language, currency, country, or market while browsing your store. With Selecty, you can create unlimited selectors tailored to match your store's design.

## What are Selectors?

Selectors provide an interactive interface for customers to switch between different store configurations. They can change:

- **Language** - View content in their preferred language
- **Currency** - See prices in their local currency
- **Country** - Navigate to country-specific offerings
- **Market** - Access different international markets
- **Combined Options** - Switch multiple settings at once (e.g., Language & Currency)

<Info>
Selectors work seamlessly with Shopify Markets. All languages, currencies, and markets must first be configured in your Shopify settings before they appear in Selecty selectors.
