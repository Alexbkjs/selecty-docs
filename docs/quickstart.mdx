## About Selecty

Selecty simplifies the international shopping experience for your customers. The app allows you to:

- Enable automatic market redirects based on visitor location
- Display recommendation banners suggesting local language and currency
- Create customizable selectors for manual language, currency, and market switching

## Step 1: Set Up Markets Recommendation Banner

We recommend starting with a recommendation banner to automatically suggest the best language and currency for your visitors.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Selecty App">
    Navigate to your Shopify admin panel and open the Selecty app from your installed apps.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Markets Recommendations">
    Scroll to the **Markets Recommendations** section and click **Customize**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Resource Type">
    Select what you want visitors to switch:
    - **Language** - Suggest their browser's preferred language
    - **Currency** - Suggest their local currency based on IP location
    - **Language & Currency** - Suggest both together
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Banner Type">
    Choose from available banner layouts:
    - **Bar** - Horizontal banner across the page
    - **Modal** - Center popup overlay
    - **Corner** - Small notification in the corner
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick Animation Style">
    Select how the banner appears:
    - Slide in
    - Fade in
    - Bounce
    - No animation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Theme">
    In the **Theme** tab, personalize your banner:
    - Colors and background
    - Button styles
    - Custom text and messaging
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Enable">
    Click **Save** in the upper right corner to publish your banner.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your recommendation banner is now live! Visitors will see it on their first visit if their location or language preferences differ from your store's default settings.
</Check>

## Step 2: Enable Markets Redirect (Optional)

Automatically redirect visitors to their local market based on geolocation.

<Warning>
Google recommends against automatic redirects for multilingual sites as it can affect SEO. We suggest using recommendation banners instead. See our [SEO guide](/advanced/seo) for more details.
</Warning>

To enable automatic redirects:

1. Navigate to the **Markets Redirect** section in Selecty
2. Toggle on the redirect options:
   - **Auto-redirect by country** - Uses IP geolocation
   - **Auto-redirect by language** - Uses browser language preference
3. Save your changes

## Step 3: Create Custom Selectors

Allow visitors to manually switch between languages, currencies, or markets.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create New Selector">
    Click **Create Selector** or **Create New** button in the Selectors section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Theme">
    Select a theme that matches your store:
    - **Basic** - Standard buttons with simple interface
    - **Material** - Modern design with strong colors
    - **Cute** - Rounded edges and soft color schemes
    - **Minimal** - Clean design focusing on content
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Resource">
    Choose what customers can switch:
    - Language only
    - Currency only
    - Country
    - Language & Currency combined
    - Market domains
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick Selector Type">
    Different types display options differently:

    - Dropdown
    - Wheel
    - Inline
    - Modal

    **Pro & Premium Plans:**
    - Layered
    - Sidebar
    - Cascade
    - Scale
    - Tape-line
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Appearance">
    Fine-tune your selector:
    - Color scheme
    - Position on page
    - Display icons and flags
    - Name format (full names, codes, native names)
    - Search functionality
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Publish">
    Click **Save** to publish your selector to your storefront.
  </Step>
</Steps>
