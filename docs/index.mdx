Selecty is a powerful Shopify app designed to enhance your international store's user experience by providing seamless language, currency, and market switching capabilities.

## What is Selecty?

If your store uses Shopify Markets, Selecty helps you design beautiful switchers and recommendation banners that allow customers to easily navigate between languages, currencies, and international markets. The app is built directly on Shopify's infrastructure and relies on Shopify Markets for proper operation.

## How Selecty Works

Selecty integrates seamlessly with Shopify Markets to provide:

- **Language Switchers**: Allow customers to view your store in their preferred language
- **Currency Switchers**: Let shoppers see prices in their local currency
- **Country Switchers**: Enable easy navigation between different country markets
- **Market Switchers**: Provide access to different international markets with unique domains
- **Recommendation Banners**: Automatically suggest the best language and currency based on visitor location
- **Multiple Store Management**: Connect and manage multiple Shopify stores for different regions

## Built on Shopify Infrastructure

Selecty is designed to work seamlessly with Shopify's native features:

- Leverages **Shopify Markets** for market management
- Supports all languages and currencies available in Shopify
- Integrates with Shopify's geolocation capabilities
- Works with Shopify Payments for local currency transactions

<Note>
Selecty enhances your store's user experience but does not replace Shopify's built-in SEO features. Shopify handles sitemap generation, hreflang tags, canonical URLs, and structured data.
