description: Understand and configure resources for selectors and banners
---


Resources are the switchable elements from your Shopify Markets that customers can change using Selecty selectors and banners. Understanding resources is key to creating effective switchers for your international store.

## What are Resources?

Resources represent the different options customers can switch between:

- **Languages** - Different language versions of your store
- **Currencies** - Various currencies for pricing display
- **Countries** - Different country markets you serve
- **Market Domains** - Separate domains or subdomains for markets
- **Custom Resources** - User-defined switching options

<Info>
Resources are pulled from your Shopify Markets configuration. Selecty reads this data and makes it available through selectors and banners.
