description: Configure and manage multiple languages for your international store
---


Selecty provides language switching capabilities that integrate seamlessly with Shopify Markets. The app allows customers to view your store content in their preferred language, creating a localized shopping experience for international audiences.

<Info>
**Selecty is built on Shopify's infrastructure**

Selecty relies entirely on Shopify Markets for language management. All languages must first be configured in your Shopify store settings before they can be used in Selecty selectors and banners.
</Info>

## How Language Support Works

### Shopify Markets Foundation

Selecty does not provide translation services or language management. Instead, it:

1. **Reads languages** from your Shopify Markets configuration
2. **Creates switchers** that allow customers to change languages
3. **Detects preferences** using browser language settings
4. **Recommends languages** based on visitor location

All actual language content, translations, and market assignments are managed through Shopify.

### Supported Languages

Selecty supports **all languages supported by Shopify**. This includes:

- All major world languages
- Regional language variants (e.g., English US vs English UK)
- Right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew)
- Languages with special characters and alphabets

For the complete list of supported languages, see [Shopify's language documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets/languages/translate).

## Configuring Languages in Shopify

Before using language selectors in Selecty, you must configure languages in Shopify Markets.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Shopify Settings">
    In your Shopify admin, go to **Settings** → **Languages**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Languages">
    1. Click **Add language**
    2. Select the language from the dropdown
    3. Choose the regional variant if applicable
    4. Click **Add**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Translate Content">
    Shopify provides several translation options:
    - **Manual translation** - Translate content yourself
    - **Translation apps** - Use Shopify translation apps
    - **Professional services** - Hire professional translators
    - **Auto-translate** - Use Shopify's machine translation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign to Markets">
    1. Go to **Settings** → **Markets**
    2. Select a market
    3. In the **Languages** section, assign languages to that market
    4. Set a primary language for each market
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Translations">
    Once translations are complete, publish them to make languages available in your store.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
After configuring languages in Shopify, they automatically become available in Selecty for use in selectors and banners. No additional configuration in Selecty is required.
</Note>

## Using Languages in Selecty

### Language Selectors

Create selectors that allow customers to switch between available languages:

1. **Open Selecty** app
2. **Create a new selector** or edit existing one
3. **Choose Resource** → Select **Language**
4. **Customize appearance** (theme, colors, position)
5. **Save and publish**

The selector will display all languages configured in your Shopify Markets.

### Language Recommendation Banner

Automatically suggest language based on browser preferences:

1. **Access Markets Recommendations** in Selecty
2. **Select Resource** → Choose **Language**
3. **Customize banner** appearance and messaging
4. **Save and enable**

The banner appears to visitors whose browser language differs from your store's default.

### Combined Language & Currency

Create selectors that switch both language and currency together:

1. **Create selector** in Selecty
2. **Choose Resource** → Select **Language & Currency**
3. **Configure settings**
4. **Save and publish**

This provides a complete localization experience in one action.

## Language Detection

### How Selecty Detects Language

Selecty identifies visitor language preferences from browser settings, not location.

**Browser Language Settings:**

Every browser maintains a list of preferred languages that users configure in settings. Selecty reads this list to determine the visitor's language preference.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chrome">
    **Settings** → **Languages**
    - View preferred languages list
    - Top language is primary preference
    - Drag to reorder languages
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Firefox">
    **Settings** → **Language**
    - Check preferred languages order
    - Add or remove languages
    - Set language preferences
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Safari">
    **Preferences** → **General**
    - Check preferred languages
    - Language order determines priority
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Edge">
    **Settings** → **Languages**
    - View preferred languages
    - Top language used for detection
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
**Important Distinction**

Browser **display language** (UI language) and **content language preference** can be different. Selecty uses the content language preference, not the display language.

Example: A user might use Chrome in German (display language) but prefer to read websites in English (content preference).
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quality Translations">
    Invest in quality translations rather than relying solely on machine translation. Poor translations harm user experience and trust.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Complete Translation Coverage">
    Translate all customer-facing content including:
    - Product descriptions
    - Navigation menus
    - Checkout process
    - Email notifications
    - Policies and legal pages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Right-to-Left Languages">
    If supporting RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew), ensure your theme properly handles RTL layout and formatting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Language Selection Visibility">
    Make language selectors easy to find, typically in the header or as a fixed element.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Default Language Strategy">
    Choose your default language based on your primary market, not the widest audience. Use recommendations to suggest alternatives.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SEO Considerations">
    Shopify automatically handles hreflang tags and language-specific SEO. Selecty doesn't interfere with these features.
  </Accordion>

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: European Multi-Language Store

**Configuration:**
- Primary market: France (French)
- Additional markets: Germany (German), Spain (Spanish)
- Languages configured in Shopify: French, German, Spanish

**Selecty Setup:**
- Language selector in header
- Recommendation banner for first-time visitors
- Combined language & currency selector

### Scenario 2: Global English Store with Translations

**Configuration:**
- Primary market: United States (English)
- Additional languages: Spanish, French, German
- All markets use English as primary, with translations

**Selecty Setup:**
- Language selector in footer
- No auto-redirect (English is universal)
- Banner suggests language to non-English browsers

### Scenario 3: Regional Language Variants

**Configuration:**
- English (United States)
- English (United Kingdom)
- English (Australia)
- Different spelling, terminology, and product descriptions

**Selecty Setup:**
- Country selector (includes language variant)
- Geolocation-based recommendations
- Manual selector for user override

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Languages not appearing in Selecty">
    **Check:**
    - Languages are added in Shopify Settings → Languages
    - Languages are assigned to at least one market
    - Translations are published (not just saved as drafts)
    - Selecty app is synced with Shopify (try refreshing)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wrong language suggested">
    **Verify:**
    - User's browser language preferences (not display language)
    - Browser settings show expected language at top of list
    - Language is actually available in your store
    - Recommendation banner is targeting correct languages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Translations not showing">
    This is a Shopify issue, not Selecty. Check:
    - Translations are complete and published in Shopify
    - Language is properly assigned to the current market
    - Theme supports multilingual content
    - Translation app (if used) is functioning correctly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Language selector shows code instead of name">
    **Adjust:**
    - Selector settings → Name format
    - Choose "Full name" instead of "Code"
    - Or select "Native name" for local language representation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Language vs Market vs Country

Understanding the difference is important:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Language">
    **What it is:** The language content is displayed in

    **Example:** English, Spanish, French

    **Configured in:** Shopify Settings → Languages

    **Selecty role:** Creates switchers for language selection
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Market">
    **What it is:** A geographical region with specific settings

    **Example:** United States market, European Union market

    **Configured in:** Shopify Settings → Markets

    **Selecty role:** Detects market and suggests appropriate language/currency
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Country">
    **What it is:** Visitor's geographical location

    **Example:** France, Germany, Japan

    **Detected by:** IP geolocation

    **Selecty role:** Uses location to suggest language and currency
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
A single market can have multiple languages (EU market might offer English, French, German), and a single language can be used across multiple markets (English in US, UK, Australia markets).
</Note>
