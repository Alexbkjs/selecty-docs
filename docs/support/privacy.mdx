description: Understand what permissions Selecty requires and how your data is protected
---


When you install Selecty, the app requests specific permissions to function properly. This page explains what permissions are required, why Selecty needs them, and how your data is protected.

## Permission Overview

During installation, you'll be asked to grant Selecty access to certain functionalities in your Shopify store. These permissions (called "scopes" in Shopify's system) allow the app to read necessary information and provide its features.

<Info>
**Important:** Selecty only requests the minimum permissions necessary to function. The app does not access customer payment information, personal customer data, or store sensitive business information.
</Info>

## What are Scopes?

**Scopes** are specific permissions that control what an app can access in your Shopify store. By confirming the Selecty installation, you grant the app access to certain functionalities.

Shopify requires all apps to clearly declare which scopes they use. This transparency helps store owners make informed decisions about app installations.
