## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Selecty?">
    Selecty is a Shopify app that creates language, currency, and market switchers for international stores. It works with Shopify Markets to provide customers with an easy way to switch between languages, currencies, and regional markets.

    **Key features:**
    - Customizable selectors (switchers)
    - Geolocation-based recommendations
    - Automatic market redirects
    - Multiple store connection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Selecty work with Shopify Markets?">
    Selecty is built entirely on Shopify's infrastructure. It reads your Shopify Markets configuration and creates user-friendly interfaces for switching between:
    - Languages you've configured in Shopify
    - Currencies assigned to your markets
    - Countries and markets you serve
    - Custom domains for different regions

    All actual market management, currency conversion, and content translation are handled by Shopify. Selecty just provides the switchers and recommendations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many languages and currencies does Selecty support?">
    Selecty supports **all languages and currencies supported by Shopify**, which includes:

    **Languages:** All languages available in Shopify Markets ([view list](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets/languages/translate))

    **Currencies:** 130+ international currencies supported by Shopify ([view list](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/markets/pricing#supported-currencies))

    The exact languages and currencies available in Selecty depend on what you've configured in your Shopify Markets settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need Shopify Markets to use Selecty?">
    Yes. Selecty relies on Shopify Markets for all market, language, and currency configuration. You must:
    - Have Shopify Markets enabled (available on all Shopify plans)
    - Configure at least one market beyond your primary market
    - Add languages and/or currencies to your markets

    Without Shopify Markets configured, Selecty won't have any data to create selectors from.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Features and Functionality

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I customize selectors?">
    Yes! Selecty provides extensive customization options:

    **Themes:**
    - Basic, Material, Cute, Minimal

    **Selector Types:**
    - Free Plan: Dropdown, Wheel, Inline, Modal
    - Pro/Premium: Layered, Sidebar, Cascade, Scale, Tape-line

    - Custom colors and fonts
    - Icon and flag display
    - Position and placement
    - Search functionality
    - Custom CSS (advanced)

    Learn more in our [Selectors guide](/features/selectors).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a recommendation banner?">
    A recommendation banner is a popup or notification that suggests the appropriate language and currency to visitors based on:
    - **Location:** Detected via IP address
    - **Browser language:** Read from browser preferences

    The banner appears on a visitor's first visit and offers to switch them to their local language and currency. Visitors can accept, decline, or dismiss the suggestion.

    **Benefits:**
    - Personalized experience without forcing changes
    - Better for SEO than automatic redirects
    - Gives users control

    Learn more in our [Markets Recommendation guide](/features/markets-recommendation).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should I use automatic redirects or recommendation banners?">
    **We recommend recommendation banners** for most stores because they:
    - Provide better SEO outcomes
    - Give users control over locale changes
    - Don't interfere with search engine indexing
    - Feel less forceful to visitors

    Google specifically recommends against automatic redirects for multilingual sites. However, automatic redirects may be appropriate for:
    - B2B stores with known customer locations
    - Completely separate regional stores
    - Specific industries where it's expected

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I connect multiple Shopify stores?">
    Yes! Selecty can connect multiple separate Shopify stores and redirect customers between them based on location.

    **Common reasons for multiple stores:**
    - Different legal entities in different countries
    - Shopify Payments not available in some regions
    - Avoiding currency conversion fees
    - Completely different product catalogs by region

    **How it works:**
    1. Install Selecty on all stores
    2. Connect stores using secure tokens
    3. Configure redirect or recommendation rules
    4. Customers automatically routed to appropriate store

    Learn more in our [Multiple Stores guide](/features/multiple-stores).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does geolocation detection work?">
    Selecty uses two types of detection:

    **Country/Currency Detection (IP Geolocation):**
    - Uses visitor's IP address
    - Assigned by Internet Service Provider
    - Determines country of residence
    - Suggests local currency

    **Language Detection (Browser Settings):**
    - Reads browser's preferred languages
    - Not based on location
    - Can be different from browser display language
    - Suggests matching language if available

    **Accuracy:** Typically 95%+ for country-level detection. May be less accurate with VPNs, proxies, or corporate networks.
