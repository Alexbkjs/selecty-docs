Understanding how Selecty impacts your store's SEO is important for maintaining search visibility while providing an excellent international customer experience.

## Selecty's Role in SEO

<Info>
**Important:** Selecty is not an SEO optimization tool. It's a user experience enhancement tool for international stores.
</Info>

### What Shopify Handles

Shopify automatically manages all critical SEO elements for multilingual and multi-market stores:

- **Sitemap generation** - XML sitemaps for all markets and languages
- **Hreflang tags** - Language and region-specific content signals
- **Canonical URLs** - Prevent duplicate content issues
- **Structured data** - Rich snippets and schema markup
- **Meta tags** - Titles, descriptions, and language declarations

### What Selecty Does

Selecty provides user interface elements to help customers navigate between markets:

- Language, currency, and market switchers
- Recommendation banners for locale suggestions
- Optional automatic redirects
- Multiple store connections

**Selecty does not interfere with Shopify's SEO features.** Your theme and Shopify's platform handle all SEO-related technical implementation.

## Impact of Automatic Redirects

The only Selecty feature that can potentially affect SEO is **automatic redirects** (Markets Redirect and cross-store redirects).

### Why Redirects Can Hurt SEO

According to [Google's guidelines on multilingual sites](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/managing-multi-regional-sites):

> "Avoid automatic redirection based on the user's perceived language. These redirections could prevent users (and search engines) from viewing all the versions of your site."

**Problems with automatic redirects:**

1. **Incomplete Indexing** - Search bots may not discover all language versions
2. **Hreflang Issues** - Language alternate tags may not be properly processed
3. **Regional Content** - Different markets' content may not appear in search results
4. **User Signals** - High bounce rates if redirects are incorrect

### Bot Detection Limitations

Selecty includes bot detection to prevent redirecting search engine crawlers. However:

<Warning>
**No bot detection is 100% accurate**

Modern programming languages cannot guarantee perfect bot identification. Some search bots may be redirected, and some human visitors may not be. This inherent limitation affects all bot detection systems.
</Warning>

## Recommended Approach

### Use Recommendation Banners

Instead of automatic redirects, we strongly recommend using [Markets Recommendation](/features/markets-recommendation) banners:

  <Card title="User Control" icon="user">

    Suggestions feel helpful, not forceful

### Best Practices for SEO

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Avoid Automatic Redirects">
    Use recommendation banners instead of automatic redirects for the best SEO and user experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Use Manual Selectors">
    Provide clear, visible language and currency selectors so users can switch markets themselves.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Ensure Proper Canonical Tags">
    When using multi-domain setups, verify your theme implements canonical tags correctly. This is the theme developer's responsibility, not Selecty's.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Monitor Search Console">
    Regularly check Google Search Console for:
    - Indexing issues
    - Hreflang errors
    - Coverage problems
    - International targeting signals
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Keep Content Unique">
    Each market should have unique, valuable content. Don't just translate—localize content for each region.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Test Bot Accessibility">
    Periodically verify that search bots can access all language and market versions of your site.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Multi-Domain Considerations

If using separate domains for different markets (example.com, example.fr, example.de), pay special attention to SEO configuration.

### Canonical Tags

**What they are:** HTML tags that tell search engines which version of a page is the "main" one

**Who manages them:** Your Shopify theme, not Selecty

**Why they matter:** Prevent duplicate content penalties when markets have similar content

<Warning>
**Theme Responsibility**

Canonical tags are generated by your theme. Selecty does not manage or interfere with canonical URLs. If you have canonical tag issues, contact your theme developer or consult Shopify support.
</Warning>

### Domain-Specific Best Practices

1. **Each domain should target its region** - Use local domain extensions (.fr, .de, .co.uk)
2. **Geo-targeting in Search Console** - Set each domain's target country
3. **Local hosting** - Consider CDN or hosting closer to target region
4. **Local backlinks** - Build links from sites in target region
5. **Localized content** - Unique content for each market, not just translations

## Shopify Markets and SEO

Shopify Markets provides built-in SEO features that work independently of Selecty:

## Common SEO Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will Selecty hurt my search rankings?">

    **Recommendation banners** are better for SEO. They don't prevent search engines from accessing all versions, and Google specifically recommends against automatic redirects for multilingual sites.

    No. Shopify automatically handles hreflang tags for Markets. Selecty doesn't interfere with this functionality.

    Canonical tags are managed by your Shopify theme, not Selecty. The app doesn't add, modify, or interfere with canonical URLs.
